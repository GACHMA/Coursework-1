      <p class="Synopsis2">Ah, the long awaited Spiderman 3. Here Peter Parker (Tom Holland) tries to erase the world's memory of him being Spiderman with the help of Dr Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) however, things don't quite work out and he ends up ripping a hole in space-time. This event creates an opening for individuals to come through from the multiverse. This leads to most of a group of past Spiderman villains, the Sinister 6, to come through and wreak havoc on New York City and the rest of the world. The world's only hope is Spiderman and his friends, can they all make it out alive? </p>

<!--The following commands allow me to put a still picture of spiderman over the cover of the video and i have 2 of the 3 formats in which the video can be played, including a download link if the browser cannot play it. I did nmot include an ogg version of the video as when trying to convert the video from mp4 and/or webm the file corrupted but both of these conversions are enough to run on most OS-->
<!--The ogg version of the video saved as an audio clip and I was unable to convert it to a video so I decided to take it out of the code instead of having a non-functional piece of code in the file which would make it look more messy with no benefit-->
