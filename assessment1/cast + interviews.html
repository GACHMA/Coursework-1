        <h2 class="TomHolland">Tom Holland</h2>
        <p>Talented actor-dancer Tom Holland was discovered in a London hip-hop dance class by choreographers for "Billy Elliot," which led to intensive training and a supporting role in the musical before he took on the title role in 2008. He received stellar reviews for his turn in the show, which then led to his casting as a brave son aiding his mother (Naomi Watts) in finding his father (Ewan McGregor) and brothers in the wake of the 2004 Asian tsunami in "The Impossible." </p>

        <h2 class="ZendayaColeman">Zendaya Coleman</h2>
        <p>As both a singer and an actress, Zendaya Coleman (who usually dropped her surname professionally) earned stardom at a very young age, thanks to her leading role on the children's sitcom "Shake It Up!" (Disney Chanel, 2010-13). Zendaya was born on Sept. 1, 1996 in Oakland, CA, where her mother worked as a stage manager and children's acting coach at the California Shakespeare Theater. While performing in numerous productions, Zendaya attended the Oakland School of the Arts before studying at the CalShakes Conservatory Program and the American Conservatory Theater, earning credits in productions of "Richard III," "As You Like It" and "Twelfth Night."</p>

        <h2 class="BenedictCumberbatch">Benedict Cumberbatch</h2>
        <p>One of the most well-respected British thespians of his generation, Benedict Cumberbatch may have taken the classic route to acting fame: spouting off Shakespeare at drama school, followed by BBC roles and eventually films, but his type of fame is decidedly 21st century.</p>
        <p class="NoInterview">Although Cumberbatch played an integral part of the film reporters lacked any chance to film him for an interview and so only Holland and Zendaya therefore have their own interview for viewing on this site.</p>
